The user indicated that they would provide a specific image and opted to adjust the dimensions for the best aesthetic fit.\n\nAdditionally, the user was offered a checklist of features for their project, noting that they wanted to implement a responsive logo design and add a matching favicon, which they confirmed. However, they chose not to enable dark/light mode adaptation, incorporate logo animation, or include an option to switch between logo versions. When further information was sought regarding size, resolution, and color scheme for the new image, the AI acknowledged, \"Great, I'm on it! Replacing the logo with the new image,\" and prompted the user to describe the project in more detail.",
